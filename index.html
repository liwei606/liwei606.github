<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
1. Project name: <b>Personalized apparel recommendation system based on image feature extraction and machine learning methods</b> </br>
<b>Duty</b>: Team leader</br>
<b>Programming Language</b>: Matlab</br>
<b>Project description</b>: In E-commerce systems, picking an item is time-consuming for individuals, which demands recommender systems with higher efficiency and accuracy, as well as support for more personalized recommendation. We propose a novel idea and framework for personalized apparel recommendation which combines both item images and textual labels by using sparse coding and support vector machine (SVM). Extensive discussions and preliminary experiment results show the practicality and validity of our framework.</br>

<h2>Internships</h2>
<p>
<a>Intel Asia-Pacific Research & Development Ltd.</a></br>
<b>Team: SSG / DPD / BiTS</b></br>
<b>Job title</b>: Software Engineer and Path Finding Research Intern</br>
<b>Description</b>: I worked in Intel Binary Translation Service group since this winter holiday. At first I built some test cases used for testing ARM NEON instructions which should be run on ARM, x86 architectures (through a binary translator) and android phone to compare the performance benchmarks. Now I am doing some path finding research on the repository (including bugzilla, email system, code repository, test information, etc.) mining and mainly focus on the information extraction from the email system. Until now, I really have learned a lot from this internship experience on both technical and soft skills.

Every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving.
